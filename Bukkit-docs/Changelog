 * Proper API (getItemList, registerItem, deregisterItem, etc., visit the Developer API page for more)
 * Reload and respawn command
 * Despawn protection against ClearLag

===== Removed: =====
 * Unnecessary item type data from items.csv (the previous format is supported for loading, but saving is done in the new format)

===== Bug fixes: =====
 * Newly dropped items are no longer despawned if the display creation fails
 * Items are no longer respawned (duped) needlessly upon chunk loading

===== Note: =====
 * This update breaks compatibility with ChestIcon 1.1 and any other plugins that were using ItemStay before 1.5.6.
